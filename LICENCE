                 YAWAT LICENSING TERMS FOR ACADEMIC USE

Yawat (Yet Another Word Alignment Tool) is a tool for the manual
creation of word alignments of parallel text. This document covers the
terms and conditions for ACADEMIC USE between you, the lincensee, and
the author of Yawat, Ulrich Germann, the licensor. By using Yawat, you
acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditons.

1. Yawat comes without any warranty or guarantee whatsoever. You use
   it entirely at your own risk and agree to hold the licensor
   harmless against all liability and obligations that could arise out
   of your use of the software, including expenses and reasonable
   counsel fees.

2. While open source software, Yawat is protected by copyright.
   Permission is granted to use Yawat free of charge for academic
   research. You are not allowed to distribute it beyond the extent
   necessary to perform word alignments. This means that you are
   allowed to deliver the underlying JavaScript files through a web
   browser to annotators, but you are not allowed to distribute the
   Yawat package (e.g., a tarball) to third parties.

3. You are allowed to make changes to and produce derivative works

   royalty-free, non-revocable, permanent licence to use and
   distribute such derivative works, including for commercial use and
   licensing. All derivative work must clearly name Yawat as the
   source and include a proper copyright notice (i.e., (c) 2006-2010
   Ulrich Germann).

4. This licence covers only use for academic research. All other use,
   especially commercial use, requires a separate licence agreement.
